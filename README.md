# Involvement Load Hypothesis Research Questionnaire

This application is a research questionnaire to measure the effectiveness of vocabulary learning methods based on the Involvement Load Hypothesis (ILH) principles.

It allows users to take a research questionnaire easily and researchers to effortlessly create ILH questionnaires, distribute them globally, and analyze results through interactive data visualizations.

## Overview
The ILH theory posits vocabulary learning is more effective when it incorporates a higher involvement load - i.e. need, search, and evaluation.

This app measures ILH scores through 3 categories of questionnaire questions:

- Need - the necessity of learning vocabulary
- Search - the effort to understand vocabulary meaning
- Evaluation - assessing vocab knowledge
Based on user responses, it calculates category scores and total ILH scores. The results are displayed in a bar chart showing the breakdown and total score.

It enables researchers to quickly evaluate vocab learning methods and iterate on questionnaires.
